## Latency CSV Files
We obtained csv files by iterating the real dataset with the simulator/accelerator provided by Sanger/Sigma/STONNE authors. The directory needs to be structured as follows:  
```
├── README.md
├── sanger
    ├── xxxx.csv 
    ├── yyyy.csv 
    ├── ...
├── sigma
    ├── vvvv.csv 
    ├── kkkk.csv 
    ├── ... 
```
Download latency performance of Sanger from the link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TnG2O9hm97e5FCUXpQQoj3t9IMvev46b?usp=sharing), and place them under the directory `sanger`.

Download latency performance of EyerissV2 from the link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GZ5QNeJY10ngnLkUr_A7yXX8u7NDRc28?usp=sharing), and place them under the directory `eyerissv2`.
